# Simple-Weather-App-Open-API

Description: On this small project, I wanted to understand how API requests works. The only HTML verb used on this case was the GET because I just wanted to make a displayable weather search app. 

Libraries:
-Requests: to make GET verb able.

-Still want to make a GUI for this app, but for know, it works as planned on terminal
